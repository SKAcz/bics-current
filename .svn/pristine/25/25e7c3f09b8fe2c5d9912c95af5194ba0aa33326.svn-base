Hi, gentlemen. There is one feature of the proposed bot that I think will cause problems, which is that you have the bot selecting the players and setting the tournament size. I think the arbiter in charge of registration needs to be in control of that. Possible problems if you let a bot do it: How does the bot exclude a banned player? How does the bot let a qualifier in? (It sounds the bot will put the qualifier at the bottom of the semi-eligible players.) 

Rather than try to explain how I think the bot should handle registration, let me create a mock registration with an imaginary bot that has the features I think are important: 

= = = = = = = = = = 

Arbiter to bot: "open" 

<The bot opens registration> 

Bot Message to ch 224: Registration for the GP tournament is now open. Tell the arbiter "I want to play" to register 


<Now assume various players tell me they want to play.>

Bot to 224: gnejs is added to the tourney. There are now 3 players, including 0 semi-eligible 


Arb to bot: "add marat" 

Bot to me: "marat is semi-eligible, add anyway?" 

<Oops, marat's rating too low, think I will wait on him...> 

Arb to bot: "n" 


Arb to bot: "add basauri" 

Bot to me: "basauri is NOT eligible, add anyway?" 

<Basauri is a qualfier, so he plays...>

Arb to bot: "add venomous"

Arb to bot: "add nitemove" 

Bot to me: "nitemove is NOT eligible, add anyway?" 

<Oops, the message suggests nitemove's rating is too low, I won't confirm this one....> 

Arb to bot: "n" 


Arb to bot: "add theraven" 

Bot to me: "TheRaven is semi-eligible, add anyway?" 

Arb to bot: "y" 

Bot to 224: TheRaven is added to the tourney. There are now 12 players, including 4 semi-eligible 


Arb to bot: "close" 

<The bot verifies all registered players are still signed on> 

Bot to me: "basauri not signed on" 

<Oops, basauri disconnected. I'll give him a minute to return.> 


<Oh, good, basauri has returned....> 

Arb to bot: "add basauri" 

Bot to me: "basauri is NOT eligible, add anyway?" 

Arb to bot: "y" 

Bot to 224: basauri is added to the tourney. There are now 12 players, including 4 semi-eligible 


Arb to bot: "close" 

<The bot verifies all registered players are still signed on> 

Bot to me: "All registered players still connected, closing registration..." 

<The bot arranges the players in rating order. Assume the order is gnejs, pminear, jkiller, ...., marat, basauri> 

Bot to 224: Registration is now closed. The player for today's tournament are: 

Bot to 224: Gnejs (1), pminear (2), jkiller (3), venomous (4), Anky (5), knightdog (6), fermy (7), tecumseh (8) 

Bot to 224: jtp (9), TheRaven (10), marat (11), basauri (12) 


Registration is complete. Now the bot can set up round 1: it sets up the three groups, then messages each player on who they should partner and who they should challenge.
