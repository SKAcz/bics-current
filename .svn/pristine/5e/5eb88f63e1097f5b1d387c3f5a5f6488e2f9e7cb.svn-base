start

Alias: No alias

Usage: start <optional tourney number>

This command starts the specified tourney if its status is "set" (in other
words, if it has been closed with "close" or by the number of players
reaching the value of the "Max Players" variable). 

The tourney number is the value of your default tourney variable if it is
not specified; otherwise the value of your default tourney variable will
change to the specified tourney number.
