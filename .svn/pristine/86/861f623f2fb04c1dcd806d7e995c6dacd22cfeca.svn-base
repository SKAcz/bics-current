listrank

Alias: rank

Usage: listrank <optional integer or handle>

This command displays a ranking of players (by their mamer rating) who
have played in at least 5 mamer tourneys.  If you don't specify a specific
handle or number, then your ranking is shown.  If you specify a handle,
then that player's ranking is shown.  If you specify a number, then
rankings near that number are shown.  For example, "mam rank 1" will show
the players near rank 1, or in other words, the top players.

Note: The ranking list can only be updated manually, so it is often
somewhat out of date.
