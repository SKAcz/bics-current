addchaos

Alias: chaos

Usage: addchaos <handle> <optional number of points> <optional reason>

Reserved for mamer managers (level of 25 or higher)

Use this command to give someone the specified number of chaos points.  If
you do not specify the number of points, 10 will be added.  To take chaos
points away, add a negative number of chaos points ("addchaos abc -10"
removes 10 of abc's chaos points). 

Whenever you add or remove chaos points, a comment is automatically added to 
that user's mamer comment file saying that you did so.  If you specify the
<optional reason>, then the reason is also added to the user's mamer
comment file.  If you use the <optional reason>, then you must also
specify the number of chaos points, even if it is 10.
