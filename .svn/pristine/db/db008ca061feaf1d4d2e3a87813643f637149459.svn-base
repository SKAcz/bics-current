Alias: games

Usage: listtourneygames <optional tourney number>

This command will list any unfinished games in the current round of the
specified tourney.  The tourney number is the value of your default
tourney variable if it is not specified; otherwise the value of your
default tourney variable will change to the specified tourney number.

Here is a sample of the output of this command:

Bd# is the board number.  Board 1 is the "top" board, where generally, the
tournament leaders are playing.  As the board number increases, the
tourney standing of the players involved generally decreases.

White is the handle of the player who has white in the game.

[SCR ] is the player's score in the current tourney.  A win is worth one
point, a draw is worth half a point, and a loss is worth zero points.

[Rtng] is the player's rating in the category of the games being played in
the tourney before the tourney starts.

The number in the rightmost column is the game number.  You would observe
the game by typing "observe <game number>".
