setres

Alias: sr

Usage: setres <white's handle> <black's handle> <result> 
              <optional tourney number>

Reserved for mamer managers (level 10 or higher)

The setres command is used to set the result of a game that is unable to be
completed by the players.  Normally, the result is set against the person who
is unable to complete the game unless he has no mating material.  The <result>
is "1" or "white" for a white win, "=" for a draw, and "0" or "black" for
a black win.

The tourney number is the value of your default tourney variable if it is
not specified; otherwise the value of your default tourney variable will
change to the specified tourney number.
