listtourneys

Alias: lt

Usage: listtourneys <optional tourney number or status>

This command lists tourneys in mamer's memory.  This includes all tourneys
currently open, all tourneys in progress, recent tourneys that have ended,
and tourneys that have been marked for saving.  When no optional argument
is used, all tourneys will be listed.  If the optional argument is a
tourney number ("mam listtourneys 3" for example), then only the specified
tourney will be displayed.  This will not change the value of your default
tourney variable.  If the optional argument is a status ("new", "open",
"set", "closed", or "done"), then only tourneys with the specified status
are displayed.  Ongoing tourneys are classified as "closed". 

Here is a sample tourney list:

"No." indicates the tourney number.
"Rds", "Sty", "Time", "Inc", "Md", "Vrnt", and "Rtng Rnge" are 
     variables that determine who may join a tourney and the type of games 
     played in the tourney.  See "mam help listtourneyvars" for more 
     detailed information about these variables.
"Status" indicates the current status of the tourney: new, open, set,
     done, or x/y, where x represents the current round number and y
     represents the total number of rounds.  "Set" tourneys are tourneys
     that have been closed but not started.
"Started at" indicates the time(using server time) and date the tourney 
     started. n/a indicates that the tourney has not yet started.
"Ended at" indicates the time(using server time) and date the tourney ended.
     n/a indicates that the tourney has not yet ended.
