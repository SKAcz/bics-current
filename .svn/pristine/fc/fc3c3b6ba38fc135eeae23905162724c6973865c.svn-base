Alias: o

Usage: open <optional tourney number>

Reserved for mamer managers (level 10 or higher)

This causes the specified tourney to be opened, allowing players to join the
tourney.  The tourney number is the value of your default tourney variable
if it is not specified; otherwise the value of your default tourney
variable will change to the specified tourney number.

Mamer cshouts and tells channel 49 the tourney announcement when the
tourney is opened.  Once a tourney is open and after it has closed, the 
only variables that can be changed are "Rounds", "Max Players", "Mode",  
and "Style".
