Usage: addlist <list> <information

>  

This command adds information to the list in question.  There are several kinds of lists 
on the server.  Some can only be modified by admins; others can be modified by 
all users.  The "sublist" command removes information from a list.

  The standard alias for "addlist" is "+".  For example, "addlist notify
 SomeGuy" could be typed as "+notify SomeGuy" instead.
