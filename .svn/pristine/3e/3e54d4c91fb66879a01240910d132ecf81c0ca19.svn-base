Mamer talking?

Yes, mamer can talk. If sometimes you see mamer talking, don't worry. It's
probably just an admin posing as mamer. SuperIntellect is known to do this
very often to give extra information in channel 49. Very rarely, mamer is
having some conversation in channel 49. You have to be lucky to see that
one though :-)
