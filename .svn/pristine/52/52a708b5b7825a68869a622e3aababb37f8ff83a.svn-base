Hi, Zon!

Here is the immortal piece:

Have fun with it and keep up the good work!
Fermy

Here is an example with 12 people:

Preturnament seeding:

1. Jkiller
2. Pminear
3. Venomous
4. Bugzilla
5. Knightdog
6. Lindegren
7. Marcusm
8. Darkfire
9. Jtp
10. Kingwaler
11. Marat
12. Fermy

Groups are Group1(#1,6,7,12), Group2(#2,5,8,11), Group3(#3,4,9,10)
Results are:

Group1           Group2           Group3
Jkiller   9      Pminear   12     Venomous   11
Lindegren 7      Marat     7      Bugzilla   9
Marcusm   7      Knightdog 6      Jtp        5
Fermy     7      Darkfire  5      Kingwalker 5

Jkiller, Pminear, Venomous, Bugzilla and Marat immediately advance to the next
stage;

In group 1 there is a 3 way tie for the 2nd. First we have to determine the
order of places.
Lindegren, Marcusm and Fermy play elimination zh. Lindegren as a highest seed
gets a bye in first round of zh. Marcusm wins over fermy. Fermy is eliminated,
he gets place #4 in the group. Now Lindegren wins over Marcusm in zh. Thus
Lindegren gets place #2 in the group and advances.

Meanwhile there is a tie for 3rd in group 3. Jtp wins over Kingwalker in zh to
get place #3 in his group.

At this point we determined the place of every player in his respective group.
First 2 places advance, so 6 people (Jkiller, Pminear, Venomous, Bugzilla,Marat
and Lindegren) already advanced.

Now we need to select two out of 3 people who get 3rd places in their groups.
Marcusm has the most points of these 3, so he advances. Finally, Knigthdog plays
jtp 2 0 zh for the final place in the next stage. Knightdog wins and advances.

Stage 2.
We have 8 people here. For stage 2 people are seeded according to the following
rule:
1. Winner of Group 1 ---    Jkiller
2. Winner of Group 2 ---    Pminear
3. Winner of Group 3 ---    Venomous
4. 2nd place of Group 3 --- Bugzilla
5. 2nd place of Group 2 --- Marat
6. 2nd place of Group 1 --- Lindegren
7. 3rd place with most points --- Marcusm
8. another 3rd place          --- Knightdog

You may notice that if there wouldn't be upset in group 2 (marat 2nd, Kdog 3rd)
the seeding
will repeat the seeding for stage 1.

Ok now we form 2 groups according to this new Seeding. The groups are:

Group 1          Group 2
Jkiller (#1)     Pminear(#2)
Bugzilla (#4)    Venomous(#3)
Marat (#5)       Lindegren (#4)
Knightdog (#8)   Marcusm (#5)

In the first round
Jkiller/Bugzilla plays Marat/Knightdog (Jkiller v Marat)
Pminear/Venomous v Lindegren/marcusm (pminear v Lindegren)

2nd round
Jkiller/Marat v Bugzilla/Kdog (jkiller v Knightdog)
Pminear/Lindegren v  Venomous/marcusm (pminear v Marcusm)

3rd round
Jkiller/Kdog v Bugzilla/marat (jkiller v bugzilla)
Pminear/marcusm v venomous/lindgegren (pminear v venomous)

That's it. Final stage is the same as in 16-players case.
