close

Alias: cl

Usage: close <optional tourney number>

Reserved for mamer managers (level 10 or higher)

This command closes the specified tourney, preventing more players from
joining.  The tourney number is the value of your default tourney variable
if it is not specified; otherwise the value of your default tourney 
variable will change to the specified tourney number.

If the amount of players who have joined reaches the "Max Players" set in
the tourney's variables, the tourney will close automatically.
