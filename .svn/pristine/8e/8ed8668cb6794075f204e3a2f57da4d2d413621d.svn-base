INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
*********************

Once ficsteambot is logged into the server, it can be controlled by an admin
who is also logged into the server:

Tell the bot 'help admin' for details on the admin commands

Player ratings are stored in the file "ftb.ratings".

There are references in the code to commands which may be specific to the FICS server.  These may need to be changed in the code when using the bot on another server.  The 'tg' server alias is one example.
