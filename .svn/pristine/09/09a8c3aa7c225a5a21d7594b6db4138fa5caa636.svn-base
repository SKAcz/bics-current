listtourneyvars

Alias: information, lv, vars

Usage: listtourneyvars <optional tourney number>

This command lists the variables for the specified tourney number.  The
tourney number is the value of your default tourney variable if it is not
specified; otherwise the value of your default tourney variable will
change to the specified tourney number.

Here is a sample variable listing:

:           (T)ime:     3 
:      (I)ncrement:     0 
:         (R)ounds:     0 
:    Max (P)layers:    16 
:           (M)ode:     r (r)ated or (u)nrated
:          (S)tyle:     s (s)wiss, (r)ound robin, (k)nock out,
:                         or (d)ouble round robin
:        (V)ariant:     w (w)ild, (r)egular, (b)ug, (s)uicide, or
(c)razyhouse
:      (W)ild Type:    10 (0), (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (8), (9)8a, (10)fr
:     Rating (L)ow:     0 
:    Rating (H)igh:  9999

:          Manager:  toddmf 

The characters enclosed in () are shortcuts that a mamer manager can use
to change the values of the variables.

Here is what each of the variables mean:

    Time         -- Same as always: minutes to start the game with
    Increment    -- Same as always: additional seconds per move
    Rounds       -- Number of rounds in the tourney. If this is 0, mamer will 
                    choose an optimal number of rounds.
    Max Players  -- The tourney will automatically close when this many
                    players have joined.
    Mode         -- Will the tourney games be rated or unrated?
    Style        -- Round Robin(everyone plays everyone), double round
                    robin(everyone plays everyone twice- one game with
                    each color), Swiss System(system where, generally
                    speaking, players play opponents with the same score
                    in the tourney each round), or knockout(single
                    elimination)?
    Variant      -- What type of game is being played?  Regular is used 
                    for blitz, standard, and lightning.
    Wild Type    -- This only appears when Variant is set to Wild.  This
                    is the type of wild that will be played.
    Rating Low   -- Players with a rating lower than this cannot join.
    Rating High  -- Players with a rating higher than this cannot join.
    Manager      -- The handle of this tourney's manager.
