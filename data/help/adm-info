Information about BICS administrators

  

BICS is run by several administrators ("admins") who ensure that BICS is working properly and deal with problem situations and cases of abuse
 (see "help etiquette").  Certain commands that regulate BICS can only be used by 
admins.

  The group of admins is small in order to keep things fair and uniform.  For
the moment, BICS has a sufficient number of admins for its needs, so new
 admins are not being added.

  If you have a question, problem situation or concern as a user, feel 
free to contact an admin.  They are designated by (*) on "who" lists.  To see
 a list of current admins, type "=admin".

  Admins tend to listen to FICS channel 1.  To contact several admins at once, 
you can "tell" to channel 1.
