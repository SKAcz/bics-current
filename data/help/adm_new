About becoming an BICS administrator

  

Thank you for asking about how someone becomes an BICS administrator
("admin"). The number of BICS admins is
 and will be kept small for several reasons.  At the moment, we are not accepting
 applications from anyone to be an admin.  If additional admins are needed, we
will send out invites to the best candidates.

  

New administrators are sometimes added, when the management of BICS feels there is a need for more admins. BICS management will send an invitation to a specific individuals, if it believes that that person has some specific skill that would be beneficial to the server. Such skills might be non-English language skills, location in a country not represented yet by the admins, or typical logins at times when there are usually very few admins logged in.

Invitations will be sent only to individuals who have demonstrated a deep knowledge of all BICS features and policies, who have demonstrated maturity, strong social skills, and helpfulness to other members, and who have some other specific skill the the server currently needs. 

In the meantime, the best way for you to help with BICS needs is to monitor 
messages on the various channels and help users who have questions. Please let 
us know about bugs you find in the server, and make suggestions about
 improvements you would like to see implemented to the current administrators.  If you have code you'd like to contribute, contact one of the 
programming admins (see "admins" help file for a listing).  Typing "=admin"
 lists the current admins.  Typing "in 0" will give a list of admins currently 
logged onto BICS at the moment.
