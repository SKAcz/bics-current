default

Several of mamers commands require a tourney number as one of their
arguments.  You can often omit this tourney number by taking advantage of
your default tourney variable.  For example, if the value of your default
tourney variable is 2, then the command "mam who" is equivalent to "mam
who 2".  The value of a user's default tourney variable can be viewed
using mamer's "finger" command.  The value of a user's default tourney 
variable will change to the specified tourney number when he/she uses one
of several commands that requires a tourney number to be specified.

Here is a chart that lists all of mamer's commands that require a tourney
number to be specified, whether or not the default tourney will be used if
the tourney number isn't specified, and whether or not the command will
change the value of the default tourney variable.

The "create" command does not take any arguments, but it changes the value
of your default tourney variable to the value of the tourney number that
was just created.

The "listtourneys" command has an optional tourney number argument. It
will not change the value of your default tourney variable.
