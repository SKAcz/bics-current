addtotourney

Alias: att

Usage: addtotourney <handle> <optional tourney number>

Reserved for mamer managers (level of 50 or higher)

This command forces <handle> to join the specified tourney number.  The
tourney number is the value of your default tourney variable if it is not
specified; otherwise the value of your default tourney variable will
change to the specified tourney number. 

Its main usage is to quickly create a test tourney, but it can also be
used to get a player new to mamer in to a tourney that is about to start
when he/she cannot figure out how to join.  If you use this command in
this fashion, please inform the player how to join future tourneys so that
the player does not rely on managers to add him/her to the tourney.
