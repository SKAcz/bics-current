addcomment

Alias: ac

Usage: addcomment <handle> <comment>

Reserved for mamer managers (level of 25 or higher)

This command adds a comment to a player's mamer comment file.  Use this to
record information about someone that you'd like all TMs to be able to
see.  This usually means exceptionally poor, good, or interesting
behavior.  Please keep comments tourney related and try to stick to facts
as much as possible (keep personal disputes out of comments).
