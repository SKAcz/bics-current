tourneytell

Alias: tt

Usage: tourneytell <tourney number> <message>

This command is used to send the specified message to all the users in the
specified tourney number, except for those using mamer's silence variable.
This is useful to avoid cluttering channel 49 with tells useful only to
those in your tourney.

Managers with a manager level of 50 or higher can send a tourneytell to
any tourney.  Other managers and users can only send tourneytells to a
tourney they are managing and/or have joined.
