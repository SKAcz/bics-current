keep

Alias: k

Usage: keep <boolean> <optional tourney number>

This command is used to edit the "keep" status of the specified tourney.
The tourney number is the value of your default tourney variable if it is
not specified; otherwise the value of your default tourney variable will
change to the specified tourney number.

If the keep status is true, mamer will not automatically delete the
tourney.  If it is false, mamer will automatically delete the tourney two
hours after its completion.  "keep 1 #" (any non-zero number will do) or
"keep y #" (y is short for yes) will set the keep status to true. Using
anything else but 1 or y will set it to false.  This command is most
commonly used to save a scheduled tourney or a tourney with bugs so that
it can be examined later.
