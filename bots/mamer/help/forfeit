forfeit

Alias: fo

Usage: forfeit <handle> <tourney number>

Reserved for mamer managers (level 10 or higher)

The "forfeit" command forfeits the specified handle from the specified 
tourney.  The value of your default tourney variable will change to the
specified tourney number.

If a player is forfeited from an open tourney, he/she is removed from the 
tourney with no penalty.  If the tourney is in progress when the player is
forfeited, the player will gain chaos points equal to 10 times the number of 
rounds he/she missed, up to a maximum of 30 points for a single tourney. 
Please remove these chaos points if you feel they are unwarranted. 

If the tourney is in progress and it is a round robin, the results of the
player's games are all set to 0-0.  If the tourney is in progress and it
is a swiss, the player's results for completed games stand, but he/she loses 
all uncompleted games by forfeit.
