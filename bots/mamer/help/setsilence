setsilence

Alias: silence

Usage: setsilence <integer>

The setsilence command is used to change the value of your mamer
silence variable, which filters tourneytells.  If you set it to 0, you
will hear all tourneytells.  If you set it to 1, you will only hear
tourneytells from the manager of the tournament.  If you set it to 2, you
will hear no tourneytells.

To view the current value of a user's mamer silence variable, use mamer's
"finger" command.
