performance

mamer's "listplayers" command lists performance ratings for the players in
the tourney.  A performance rating is what the player's USCF(several
other organizations use the same formula) rating would be if this tourney
was the player's first tourney.  Here is the formula.

         Perf. Rating = Avg. opp. rating + 400 * ((wins-losses)/rounds)

Your performance rating is for the current tourney only.
