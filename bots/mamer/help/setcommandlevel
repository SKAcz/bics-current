setcommandlevel

Alias: setcl

Usage: setcommandlevel <command> <level>

Reserved for mamer managers (level 50 or higher)

This command sets the minimum manager level required to use <command> to
<level>.  You can only modify the level of commands that require a level
lower than or equal to yours to use, and you can only modify it to or
below your manager level.  The most common use for this is to disable a
buggy command or to stop tourneys from being created temporarily to make
room for a scheduled event.
