delete

Alias: d

Usage: delete <tourney number>

Use the "delete" command to delete the specified tourney.  The value of  
your default tourney variable will change to the specified tourney number.

The most common usage of "delete" is to delete a tourney in which there
are not enough players to close and start.  Mamer deletes tourneys that
are not "kept" two hours after their completion.  Please do not delete the
tourneys before then, as many users view the standings of recent tourneys.
