finger

Alias: fi

Usage: finger <optional handle>

Use the "finger" command to find out a player's mamer statistics.  If you do
not specify the handle, you will see your own statistics.  Here is a sample 
"finger":

:toddmf's Stats:
:
:Name               Tnys   W    L   D  1st 2nd 3rd Chaos Rating
:----------------- ----- ---- ---- --- --- --- --- ----- ------
:toddmf              815 1918  818 143 310 228   1     0   1.48 
:
:Default Tourney =    1  Silence =  0
:
:Manager Level: 75     Managed Tourneys: 2035 

"Name" is the handle of the player you are fingering.
"Tnys" is the number of tourneys he/she has played in.
"W" is the number of games he/she has won in tourneys.
"L" is the number of games he/she has lost in tourneys.
"D" is the number of games he/she has drawn in tourneys.
"1st" is the number times he/she has finished in or tied for first place.
"2nd" is the number times he/she has finished in or tied for second place.
"3rd" is the number times he/she has finished in or tied for third place.
"Chaos" is the number of Chaos Points he/she has.
"Rating" is the player's mamer rating.
"Default Tourney" is the tourney number that his/her commands default to.
"Silence" is the value of his/her mamer silence variable.
"Manager Level" is his/her manager level (displayed only for mamer
     managers).
"Managed Tourneys" is the number of tourneys he/she has managed (displayed
     only for mamer managers).


NOTE: "3rd"s have been recorded for a much shorter time than "1st"s and 
      "2nd"s.  Also, 3rds are only recorded for tourneys with at least 8
      players, and 2nds are only recorded for tourneys with at least
      6 players.  This explains the low number of 3rd place finishes many
      users have.
