Here is an example with 16 people:

Preturnament seeding:

1. Jkiller
2. Pminear
3. Venomous
4. Bugzilla
5. Knightdog
6. Lindegren
7. Marcusm
8. Darkfire
9. Jtp
10. Kingwaler
11. Marat
12. Fermy
13. Burgsvik
14. Valdushka
15. TheRaven
16. Ishamael

Then I put people in each group in order of places that they got. The only unclear moment here is
why pminear and not marcusm is the winner of Group 2 and the answer is: 
because pminear was a higher seed at the beginning of this stage.


Group1       Group2          Group3        Group 4
--------------------------------------------------
Darkfire 11  Pminear     10  Venomous 12   Fermy 10
Jkiller 9    Marcusm     10  Lindegren 8   Burgsvik 8
Jtp 5        Kingwalker  6   Valdushka 6   Knightdog  6
Ishamael 5   TheRaven    4   Marat 4       Bugzilla 6

Now we go to the stage 2 in which 8 people participate => 2 groups.

Stage 2:
Group1:  Darkfire (winner of group 1) Fermy(winner of group 4) Lindegren (2nd
place of group 3)  Marcusm (2nd place in group 2). They are SEEDED IN THE GROUP
in this order.  That is Darkfire is the highest seed and marcusm is the lowest.

Therefore, in round 1 darkfire partners fermy and they play 5 games against Lindegren-Marcusm
darkfire (seed#1 in the group) plays against Lindegren (seed #3 in the group)

Then, Darkfire (#1) partners Lindegren (#3) and they play Fermy(#2) and Marcusm(#4);
Darkfire (#1) plays against Marcusm (#4)

Finally Darkfire (#1) partners marcusm (#4) and plays versus Fermy (#2) and Lindegren (#3).
Darkfire(#1) plays against Fermy(#2)


Now suppose result is
Darkfire 8
Marcusm 8
Fermy 8
Lindegren 6


This is a 3-way tie for 1st place. Only One has to be eliminated. Darkfire (the
highest seed in the group) is considered the winner. Fermy and marcusm play 2 0
crazyhouse. Marcusm wins and he get's place #2 in the group.


Now on to another group. In order of seed we have:
Group2: Pminear (winner of group 2) Venomous (winner of group 3) Burgsvik (2nd
place in group 4) Jkiller
(second place in group 1).
Round1: Pminear/Venomous v Burgsvik/Jkiller (pminear v burgsvik)
Round2: Pminear/burgsvik v Venomous/jkiller (pminear v Jkiller)
Round3: Pminear/Jkiller v Venomous/Burgsvik (pminear v Venomous).


Suppose the result is
Jkiller 9
Pminear 7
Venomous 7
Burgsvik 7


This is 3-way tie for 2nd. Jkiller is clear winner of the group. 3 other play
elimination crazyhouse to determine a second place. Pminear as a highest seed in
the group get's by in the first round of zh. Venomous plays burgsvik and
venomous wins. Burgsvik is eliminated. Now venomous plays pminear. Pminear wins
and gets second place.


Final Stage
Order of seeds in the group is:
Darkfire (winner of group 1) Jkiller (winner of group 2) Pminear (2nd in group
2) marcusm second in group 1).


Therefore, The order of play is:
1. dfire/jk v pm/marcusm (dfire v pm)
2. dfire/pm v jk/marcusm (dfire v marcusm)
3. dfire/marcusm v jk/pm (dfire v jk).


Pminear 10
Jkiller 8
Venomous 8
Fermy 4
